132. Random Number Generation in Javascript: Building a Love Calculator 

-> create a random number
-> create a random number between 1 and 6
-> create a love calculator 
    -> create 2 prompts so the people can enter there names
    -> create a random number between 1 and 100 
    -> write an alert with the random number 


133. Control Statements: Using If-Else Conditionals & Logic

-> create and if-else Statement with  1 condition (>70%) and 
2 msg(one for if , one for else)


134. Comparators and Equality

-> enumerate 6 of them 
-> difference between "===" and "==" ?


135. Combining Comparators

-> write the code (if/else) for conditions : >70, >30 and <70, <30

BMI Calculator ADvanced(IF/ELSE)

Write a function that outputs(returns) a different message depending on the BMI

BMI < 19.5 the output should be :"Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight."
BMI 18.5-24.9 the output should be :"Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have normal weight."
BMI > 24.9 the output should be :"Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."

The msg MUST be returned as an output from your function. 
You should NOT NEED to use alert, promt, or console.log in this challenge.
IMPORTANT, the message wording has to match precisely for the code to pass the validation. 
Including punctuation and capitalisation.

BMI = weight/height^2

function bmiCalculator (weight, height) {
    return interpretation;
}


136. Introducing the Leap Year Code Challenge

Leap year:
-> divisible by 4
-> exept every year that is evenly divisible by 100
-> unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

function isLeap(year){
    
}


138. Collections: Working with Javascript Arrays

-> create a script that check if a name is in a array (use alerts)


139. Adding Elements and Intermediate Array Techniques

-> write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
-> for multiples of 3 print "Fizz"
-> for multiples of 5 print "Buzz"
-> for multples of 3,5 print "Fizz,Buzz" 
!! use .push method

-> what .push/.pop method does ? how it works ?


--> Who's buying lunch? Code challenge <--

-> write a function which will select a random name from a list of names
-> the person selected buy luch for everyone
-> use return (no need for alert, prompt or console.log)

Input:
["Angela", "Ben", "Jenny", "Michael", "Chloe"]

Output:
Michael is going to buy lunch today!

function whosPaying(names){
    // code... 
}


141. Control Statements: While Loops

-> write the program

1 bottles of beer on the wall, 1 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

.
.
.

1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, no more bottle of beer on the wall.

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bootles of beer.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.


143. Control Statements: For Loops

-> create FizzBuzz with For Loop
-> use an array 
-> use .push method
